# Wheel

This project reinvents the wheel in C++ to a certain extent, think of this as
an alternative/complement to C++'s `std` containers and utilities.

Wheel is meant as an alternative to some of the standard functionality, as a
means of not only learning but also correcting certain design decisions. These
headers are simple yet quite opinionated, they are made to be pretty general,
but keep in mind this was created with a more procedural style of programming
in mind, instead of the usual OOP promoted by C++. Although the containers are
made thinking about classes as potential arguments, do not expect any of this
to be friendly to highly encapsulated OO systems.
